# SouthernCravings
The idea started when we explored several food websites and Instagram pages and realized how beautifully they showcased their culture through food. That inspired us to build something similar, focused on authentic South Indian snacks â€” from the crispy murukku of Tamil Nadu to spicy banana chips from Kerala. Our goal was simple: celebrate the rich snack culture of South India through a clean and responsive web platform.

We built the project using HTML, CSS, and BootstrapðŸ’». I also used Bootstrap JavaScript components to make the login and create account pages pop up directly on the homepage â€” giving it a real-world website feel.

But this wasnâ€™t just about putting code together â€” we learned a lot through this journey.
One big lesson? Not every color looks good on a website! We spent time exploring color palettes, figuring out which shades work well together, and how to keep things visually pleasing and easy on the eyes.

We also realized how important high-quality, relevant images are in food-based platforms. They donâ€™t just fill space â€” they tell a story. And of course, we made sure our site was responsive on all devices, because thatâ€™s something we see in every great website.

Southern Cravings is more than a project to us â€” itâ€™s our way of blending tradition with technology and showing whatâ€™s possible when creativity meets collaboration.
